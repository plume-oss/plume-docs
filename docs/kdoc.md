The documentation for the API is written using KDoc and generated with Orchid + Dokka.
Each library has its own link:

* [Driver](https://plume-oss.github.io/plume-driver/)
* [Extractor](https://plume-oss.github.io/plume-extractor/index.html)

Plume uses [Apache Log4j 2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/) for logging 
and logs are written and backed up to `$TEMP/plume`.
