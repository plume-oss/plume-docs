## Driver Configuration and Usage

OverflowDb is an in-memory storage backend option with an overflow to disk mechanism when memory starts filling up. This can be obtained as follows:
```kotlin
val driver = DriverFactory(GraphDatabase.OVERFLOWDB) as OverflowDbDriver
```

This will simply create an in-memory database with overflow enabled. To specify where the 
database will be serialized/deserialized/overflowed make use of 
OverflowDbDriver::setStorageLocation` method as follows:
```kotlin
driver.setStorageLocation("/path/to/file.bin")
```
This exported graph can then be loaded back into the driver by specifying the same path.

Other configuration options:

```kotlin
// To specifies if OverflowDb should write to disk when memory is constrained
driver.setOverflow(false) // default true
// Percentage of the heap from when overflowing should begin to occur
driver.setHeapPercentageThreshold(90) // default 80%
// If specified, OverflowDB will measure and report serialization/deserialization timing averages
driver.setSerializationStatsEnabled(true) // default false
```

## Benefits of using OverflowDB

### Low memory footprint

OverflowDB enforces a strict schema and uses implicit/virtual edges to help lower the memory
footprint. When memory does become limited, OverflowDB will start serializing instances
to disk and out of the heap to avoid `OutOfMemoryError`.

By making use of a strict schema using domain classes, memory isn't wasted on many `Map`
instances as is the case with [TinkerGraph](tinkergraph.md).

### High performance

Due to the whole graph being in-memory the performance is fast (until swapping to disk 
occurs).

### Production

There are many use cases where a dedicated storage backend is not necessary. Here are a few applications:

* For analysis on smaller programs or parts of programs where its feasible to store snapshots of graphs in something compact such as the `bin` format.
* To be part of a DevSecOps lifecycle where the process is run on low resource containers and the graph itself may be disposable but the results can be stored elsewhere.
* High performance is required, but no expertise/resources available for dedicated backends.
